#you can think of a negative index, s[-4], as a shorthand for the equivalent s[len(s)-4].
#The [n] operation is called indexing, and the [n:m] is called slicing. Both operations return a new string, 
#leaving the original unchanged. Since python strings are immutable, 
#you cannot use an index or slice expression on the left of an assignment. 
#Note that immutability means you cannot update an existing value, but you can, of course, 
#change a variable to a new value. For instance:
 
#fred[1] = 'Q'
 
#is illegal, but you can do this instead:
 
#fred = fred[0] + 'Q' + fred[2:]
